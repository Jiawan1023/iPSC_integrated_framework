# iPSC_integrated_framework
Pipelines and scripts used to perform the bioinformatics analyses to build integrated framework for functional dissection of variable expressivity in genetic disease.


Respository Organization

This repository contains scripts for perform the bioinformatics analyses in the paper. Files are organized into six main directories, each with additional READMEs. Brief description will be shown here. The  six main directories are:

1_Figure_code
Figure_code folder contains scripts to generate plots for the figures in the paper.
generate_heatmap.R for Figure1(c,d), Figure4(g), Figure6(e), Suppfig1(g), Suppfig4(c), Suppfig11(a).
generate_dotplot.R for Figure 1(e), Figure 2(b,c), Suppfig 1(e), Suppfig 3(b), Suppfig 8(d) and Suppfig 11 (a)
barplot.R for Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 6, Figure 5, Suppfig 8 and Suppfig 10.
volcanoplot.R for Suppfig 1c, Suppfig 2a and Suppfig 7d.
upsetplot.R for Figure 4 (b).
waterfallplot.R for Figure 4 (g), Suppfig 1 (f) and Suppfig 6(c).
densityplot. R for Figure 5 (b) and Suppfig 9 (a).
lineplot.py for Suppfig 2(c).
violinplot.R for Figure 3 (a), Suppfig 4(a), Suppfig 5

2_Enrichment_analysis
